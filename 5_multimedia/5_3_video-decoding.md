## 5.3\. Video Decoding

<div class="note">
Video codecs are optional for Android Watch device implementations.
</div>

Device implementations&mdash;

*   MUST support dynamic video resolution and frame rate switching through the
    standard Android APIs within the same stream for all VP8, VP9, H.264, and
    H.265 codecs in real time and up to the maximum resolution supported by each
    codec on the device.

*   Implementations that support the Dolby Vision decoder&mdash;
   *   MUST provide a Dolby Vision-capable extractor.
   *   MUST properly display Dolby Vision content on the device screen or on a
       standard video output port (e.g., HDMI).

*   Implementations that provide a Dolby Vision-capable extractor MUST set the
    track index of backward-compatible base-layer(s) (if present) to be the same
    as the combined Dolby Vision layer's track index.

### 5.3.1\. MPEG-2

Android device implementations with MPEG-2 decoders must support the Main
Profile High Level.

### 5.3.2\. H.263

Android device implementations with H.263 decoders MUST support Baseline Profile
Level 30 and Level 45.

### 5.3.3\. MPEG-4
Android device implementations with MPEG-4 decoders MUST support Simple Profile
Level 3.

### 5.3.4\. H.264

Android device implementations with H.264 decoders:

*   MUST support Main Profile Level 3.1 and Baseline Profile.<br>
    Support for ASO (Arbitrary Slice Ordering), FMO (Flexible Macroblock Ordering)
    and RS (Redundant Slices) is OPTIONAL.
*   MUST be capable of decoding videos with the SD (Standard Definition)
    profiles listed in the following table and encoded with the Baseline Profile and
    Main Profile Level 3.1 (including 720p30).
*   SHOULD be capable of decoding videos with the HD (High Definition) profiles
    as indicated in the following table.
*   In addition, Android Television devices&mdash;
    *   MUST support High Profile Level 4.2 and the HD 1080p60 decoding profile.
    *   MUST be capable of decoding videos with both HD profiles as indicated
        in the following table and encoded with either the Baseline Profile, Main
        Profile, or the High Profile Level 4.2
