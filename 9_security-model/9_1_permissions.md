## 9.1\. Permissions

Device implementations MUST support the
[Android permissions model](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html) as
defined in the Android developer documentation. Specifically, implementations
MUST enforce each permission defined as described in the SDK documentation; no
permissions may be omitted, altered, or ignored. Implementations MAY add
additional permissions, provided the new permission ID strings are not in the
android.\* namespace.

Permissions with a `protectionLevel` of ['PROTECTION_FLAG_PRIVILEGED'](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PermissionInfo.html#PROTECTION_FLAG_PRIVILEGED)
MUST only be granted to apps preloaded in the whitelisted privileged path(s)
of the system image, such as the `system/priv-app` path in the AOSP
implementation.

Permissions with a protection level of dangerous are runtime permissions.
Applications with targetSdkVersion > 22 request them at runtime. Device
implementations:

*   MUST show a dedicated interface for the user to decide whether to grant the
requested runtime permissions and also provide an interface for the user to
manage runtime permissions.
*   MUST have one and only one implementation of both user interfaces.
*   MUST NOT grant any runtime permissions to preinstalled apps unless:
    *   the user's consent can be obtained before the application uses it
    *   the runtime permissions are associated with an intent pattern for which
the preinstalled application is set as the default handler

Android Television devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to provide a user-accessible
mechanism to grant or revoke access to the usage stats in response to the
[android.settings.ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.html#ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS)
intent for apps that declare the android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission.
All other device implementations MUST provide this mechanism unless the implementation
made a conscious design decision to altogether prevent any app, including the
pre-installed apps, from having granted this permission.
