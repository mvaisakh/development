# 9\. Security Model Compatibility

Device implementations MUST implement a security model consistent with the
Android platform security model as defined in
[Security and Permissions reference document](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html)
in the APIs in the Android developer documentation. Device implementations MUST
support installation of self-signed applications without requiring any
additional permissions/certificates from any third parties/authorities.
Specifically, compatible devices MUST support the security mechanisms described
in the follow subsections.
